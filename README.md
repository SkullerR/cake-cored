# CakeCORED README

Simple vs-code Extension that outputs the current Debug value from your current opened project and allows changing the DEBUG value with a simple click on the Status bar label.

## Features

The status bar label shows the current Debug value from your project.

When clicked, it changes the Debug value from app.php or core.php automatically for you.


## Requirements

Works on CakePHP 2^ and CakePHP 3^ while the ./config/app.php or the ./app/Config/core.php files exists.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1

Initial release of CakeCORED with basic functions.
